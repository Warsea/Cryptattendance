# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

contract-address: 0x5fbdb2315678afecb367f032d93f642f64180aa3

Note: Make sure your hardhat node is running:

npx hardhat node

And the contract is deployed:

npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
